    "\n",
    "   * LeetCode runtime is **not deterministic**.\n",
    "   * Each run is affected by server load, caching, and Python interpreter warm-up.\n",
    "   * A 10‚Äì20ms gap is often just noise, not a guaranteed performance difference.\n",

    "   * Your `s0/s1 balance` version avoids `min()` and multiple variable swaps.\n",
    "   * It only uses **two counters** (`s0`, `s1`) and updates them with simple arithmetic.\n",
    "   * The greedy version does `min(prev, curr)` and frequent assignments, which adds tiny overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branching behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In your version, updates happen in a tighter loop with fewer resets.\n",
    "   * Greedy version does an extra branch whenever the character switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory locality**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Both are `O(1)` space, but your counters may stay hot in CPU registers, while greedy‚Äôs `prev_len`/`curr_len` swaps might spill to memory more often.\n",
