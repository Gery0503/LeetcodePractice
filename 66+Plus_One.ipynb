    "### üéØ Problem Statement Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôre given a non-empty array `digits` where each element represents a digit of a large integer (most significant to least). Our task is to **increment this number by one** and return the resulting array of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Mindset & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "As an engineer, I always begin by **identifying edge cases** and **seeking O(n) or better solutions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-step Thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start from the Least Significant Digit (LSD):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We know that addition begins from the rightmost digit, just like in manual arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If current digit < 9**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Simple increment, return early.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If digit == 9**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Set to 0 and continue the carry to the next digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If we reach the beginning (all 9s)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We prepend a `1` at the front and fill the rest with `0`s.\n",
    "   * For example, `[9, 9]` ‚Üí `[1, 0, 0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us an **O(n) time and O(1) space solution** (excluding the returned list).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient**: Linear scan from end to start, optimal for worst-case (e.g., `[9, 9, 9, ..., 9]`).\n",
    "* **No conversion to integer/string**: Avoids unnecessary overhead.\n",
    "* **Handles carry properly** using simple logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "| Space        | **O(1)** (in-place)  |\n",
    "| Return Space | **O(n + 1)** (worst) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is practical in systems where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision matters**: e.g., large integers in financial or scientific computations.\n",
    "2. **Memory constraints**: Where using large native integers is costly or unavailable.\n",
    "3. **Custom Number Representations**: Embedded systems or blockchain implementations often store numbers in digit arrays.\n",
    "4. **Manual-style arithmetic engines**: Like implementing arbitrary-precision math in Python or C.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Feedback as a FAANG Interviewer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're approaching this problem with the right mindset: clear edge case awareness, precise iteration, and in-place operations. I appreciate that you emphasized **early return optimization** and **constant space reasoning**, which show engineering maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to improve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You might briefly mention Python‚Äôs handling of list immutability and integer overflow safety, especially when comparing to lower-level languages like C++ or Java.\n",
    "* Be ready to implement this in a language like **C** or **Go**, where memory management isn‚Äôt abstracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What I would do next**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I‚Äôd ask how you'd generalize this to subtraction (`minusOne`), which introduces borrow propagation and negative handling.\n",
    "* I‚Äôd challenge with a follow-up: ‚ÄúHow would you implement this for a number represented as a **linked list of digits**?‚Äù\n",
