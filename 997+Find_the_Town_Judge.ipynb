    "In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the town judge exists, then:\n",
    "1. The town judge trusts nobody.\n",
    "2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.\n",
    "3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that the person labeled `a` trusts the person labeled `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.\n",

    "Input: `n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]`\n",

    "- `1 <= n <= 1000`\n",
    "- `0 <= trust.length <= 10^4`\n",
