    "# 455. Assign Cookies\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.\n",
    "Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, you can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of content children and output the maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `g = [1,2,3]`, `s = [1,1]`\n",
    "Output: `1`\n",
    "Explanation: Only the child with `g[0] = 1` can be content with a cookie of size `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `g = [1,2]`, `s = [1,2,3]`\n",
    "Output: `2`\n",
    "Explanation: One way is to assign cookie size `1` to child with `g[0] = 1`, and size `2` to child with `g[1] = 2`, making both children content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",

    "Great job documenting and structuring your notebook 👌 — I’ll do a **code review** in four parts: correctness, complexity, style, and potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The implementation is **correct**. Sorting both lists and using two pointers is the canonical greedy solution.\n",
    "* All provided test cases pass, including cases where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * cookies < children (`[1,2,3],[1,1]`)\n",
    "  * cookies > children (`[1,2],[1,2,3]`)\n",
    "  * unsorted inputs (`[2,1,3],[1,1]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time:** Sorting dominates, so **O(n log n + m log m)** where `n = len(g)`, `m = len(s)`. You simplified it as `O(n log n)` — that’s fine in interviews if you clarify both lists are sorted.\n",
    "* **Space:** Currently noted as **O(n)**, but in fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sorting in Python `sorted()` uses **Timsort**, which is *O(n)* auxiliary memory in worst case, but often closer to O(1) if data is partially ordered.\n",
    "  * The two-pointer loop itself is **O(1)** extra space.\n",
    "  * So: **O(n + m)** worst case (if both lists require full sorting).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 Style\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code is clean and readable.\n",
    "* Variable names `i, j` are conventional for pointers but could be slightly more descriptive (`child`, `cookie`) for clarity.\n",
    "* Adding docstrings or inline comments would help if this were production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Greedy two-pointer solution:\n",
    "        - Sort both greed factors (g) and cookie sizes (s).\n",
    "        - Use two pointers to assign smallest available cookie that satisfies current child.\n",
    "        - Move child pointer only when satisfied.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        g.sort()\n",
    "        s.sort()\n",
    "        child = cookie = 0\n",
    "        while child < len(g) and cookie < len(s):\n",
    "            if g[child] <= s[cookie]:\n",
    "                child += 1  # child satisfied\n",
    "            cookie += 1   # always move cookie\n",
    "        return child\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-place sorting**\n",
    "   You don’t need to create new lists via `sorted()`. Use `.sort()` to sort in-place and save memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   g.sort()\n",
    "   s.sort()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explicit complexity comment**\n",
    "   Instead of just `O(n log n)`, better to state:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Time: O(n log n + m log m)\n",
    "   # Space: O(1) extra (in-place), O(n + m) worst case if using sorted()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **More edge case tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * No cookies (`g=[1,2,3], s=[] → 0`)\n",
    "   * No children (`g=[], s=[1,2,3] → 0`)\n",
    "   * Very large numbers (`g=[10**9], s=[10**9] → 1`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Verdict**: Excellent solution — correct, simple, and efficient.\n",
    "🔧 Minor improvements: use `.sort()` for in-place sorting, refine complexity comments, and add more edge tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want me to **revise your notebook JSON** so that it reflects the in-place `.sort()` improvement and more precise complexity notes?\n"
