    "You are given a 2D grid `grid` where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally and vertically (not diagonally), and the grid is completely surrounded by water. The grid contains exactly one island (one or more connected land cells), which has no 'lakes' (water inside that isn’t connected to the surrounding water).\n",
    "Each cell is a square with side length 1. Determine the perimeter of the island.\n",

    "## ✅ Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity of Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You clearly included the problem description, examples, and constraints.\n",
    "   * That’s excellent for self-documentation and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Good Intuition Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You summarized your plan (\"count 1’s, deduct for neighbors\") → matches the implemented approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Time complexity `O(m*n)` and space complexity `O(1)` are correctly stated.\n",
    "   * The logic of `+4` then subtracting neighbors is clean and correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tests Provided**\n",

    "   * You wrote assertions with both provided examples and some extra edge cases. That’s solid practice.\n",

    "## ⚠️ Review Points (Things to Improve)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Redundant Neighbor Checks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if i >= 1:\n",
    "    perimeter -= grid[i-1][j]\n",
    "if i < rows-1:\n",
    "    perimeter -= grid[i+1][j]\n",
    "if j >= 1:\n",
    "    perimeter -= grid[i][j-1]\n",
    "if j < cols-1:\n",
    "    perimeter -= grid[i][j+1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This checks *all four directions*.\n",
    "👉 But you only need to check **up and left** (or down and right). Each shared edge gets counted twice otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can simplify:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if i > 0:\n",
    "    perimeter -= 2 * grid[i-1][j]   # subtract 2 for shared vertical edge\n",
    "if j > 0:\n",
    "    perimeter -= 2 * grid[i][j-1]   # subtract 2 for shared horizontal edge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This halves neighbor checks and is slightly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Loop Style Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `enumerate` is fine, but you can make the loop more explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(rows):\n",
    "    for j in range(cols):\n",
    "        if grid[i][j] == 1:\n",
    "            perimeter += 4\n",
    "            if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 1: perimeter -= 2\n",
    "            if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 1: perimeter -= 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This removes extra conditionals and improves readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Test Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "You covered simple shapes.\n",
    "👉 Suggest also testing **long skinny islands** and **full grid** to check performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert Solution().islandPerimeter([[1]*100]) == 202\n",
    "assert Solution().islandPerimeter([[1]*100 for _ in range(100)]) == 400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Naming / Style**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rows`, `cols` ✅ good readability.\n",
    "* Could rename `cell` → unused variable (since you skip when `cell==0` anyway). Just check `if grid[i][j]:`.\n",
