    "### üéØ Problem Summary: 367. Valid Perfect Square\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a **positive integer `num`**, and the task is to determine **whether it is a perfect square** ‚Äî that is, whether there exists an integer `n` such that `n * n == num`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No usage of built-in square root functions.\n",
    "* `1 <= num <= 2¬≥¬π - 1` (i.e., can be very large).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Intuition & Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My first instinct is **binary search**. The reasoning is simple: the square of an integer is a **monotonically increasing function**. That makes it a perfect candidate for binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We search for a number `mid` such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `mid¬≤ == num`, return `True`\n",
    "* If `mid¬≤ > num`, shrink the upper bound\n",
    "* If `mid¬≤ < num`, increase the lower bound\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **mathematically precise** and scales efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set lower and upper bounds**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Start with `lower = 1`, `upper = num // 2 + 1` (because for any `num > 1`, its square root is less than `num // 2 + 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compute the square of the midpoint.\n",
    "   * Compare to the target number.\n",
    "   * Narrow the range accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For `num = 1`, it‚Äôs already a perfect square.\n",
    "   * Works well up to `2^31 - 1` because Python handles large integers without overflow.\n",

    "### üß† Why Not Use `sqrt()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the problem explicitly prohibits it. Also, even if allowed, floating-point approximations can be imprecise for very large values (e.g., `sqrt(2147395600)` vs. `sqrt(2147395601)`), leading to subtle bugs.\n",

    "1. **Graphics & Simulations**: Perfect square checks often occur in grid layouts, collision systems, or pixel operations.\n",
    "2. **Mathematics & Education Tools**: Checking for perfect squares is a basic step in factorization, simplifying square roots, etc.\n",
    "3. **Cryptography**: Number-theoretic operations frequently rely on properties of squares or primes.\n",
    "4. **Hashing**: Some hash techniques use perfect-square sequences for bucketing or probing strategies.\n",
    "5. **Memory Alignment**: OS and VM memory models often calculate power-of-two or perfect-square allocations for efficiency.\n",
