    "## ✅ Interviewee Statement (Confident & Structured)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👋 Introduction & Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for the opportunity. When I first saw this problem — **finding the intersection of two arrays where duplicates count** — my immediate thought was to apply frequency counting to map how many times each number appears. From experience, this is a common pattern in problems involving multisets or bags rather than traditional sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Step-by-Step Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 1. **Use a Counter on the First Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to remember how many times each number appears in `nums1`. Python’s `collections.Counter` is perfect here and gives us O(1) access for any value’s frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 2. **Iterate Over `nums2`**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each value in `nums2`, if it exists in the counter and its count is non-zero, we decrement the count and add it to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We don’t overcount duplicates.\n",
    "* Each element appears **as many times as it shows in both arrays.**\n",

    "\n",
    "| Approach     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Assumption          |\n",
    "| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |\n",
    "| Hash Map     | O(n + m)        | O(min(n, m))     | Unsorted input      |\n",
    "| Two Pointers | O(n + m)        | O(1)             | Input arrays sorted |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of operation is commonly needed in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log analysis systems**: Correlating events from multiple sources that may overlap partially.\n",
    "* **E-commerce inventory**: Finding overlapping SKUs between warehouses or suppliers.\n",
    "* **Medical record merging**: Identifying duplicate or overlapping patient entries.\n",
    "* **Recommender systems**: Matching users’ past behavior to catalog content with shared tags or metadata.\n",

    "## 👨‍💼 Interviewer Feedback (as Interviewer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for the explanation — your confidence and clarity are impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You identified the correct data structure (`Counter`) immediately, which shows strong familiarity with standard library tools.\n",
    "* You cleanly transitioned to the optimized sorted solution — that’s the kind of practical flexibility we expect at Google.\n",
    "* You covered edge cases implicitly (e.g., arrays of unequal length, disjoint inputs).\n",
    "* You explained space/time trade-offs and related real-world scenarios, showing depth of understanding beyond algorithm mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "If I were in your position, I might also proactively suggest how to handle the **\"large dataset on disk\"** follow-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"If `nums2` is on disk and can't fit in memory, I’d stream it and load `nums1` into memory as a hash map, ensuring we only hold the minimal set needed for intersection.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That foresight would showcase not only algorithmic insight but systems thinking — something highly valued in engineering teams at scale.\n",
