    "This is a clean and fully functional implementation of the Pascal's Triangle generation. The logic correctly follows the definition, using the previous row to calculate the elements of the current row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed review, along with a slightly refactored version of the code for better conciseness and generalized handling of edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Review\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Logic and Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Positive:** The logic for generating the subsequent rows is perfect. The inner loop `for j in range(len(previous)-1):` correctly iterates over the pairs of elements in the previous row, and the use of `current.append(1)` at the beginning and end ensures the structure is maintained.\n",
    "* **Minor Improvement (Redundancy):** The initial `if/elif` statements for `numRows == 1` and `numRows == 2` are redundant. You can initialize the result with an empty list or `[[1]]` and generalize the main loop to cover these cases, making the code shorter and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Style and Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minor Improvement (Loop Type):** Since you know the exact number of iterations (`numRows`), a `for` loop is generally more idiomatic in Python than a `while` loop with a manual counter (`i += 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Complexity Analysis (Correction)\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed a slight error in your initial complexity analysis within the intuition cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity: O(N²)**. **Correct.** The total number of operations is proportional to the total number of elements generated, which is the sum $1 + 2 + \\dots + N$, or $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is `numRows`.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity: O(1)**. **Incorrect.** You are storing the entire triangle, which contains $O(N^2)$ elements. Therefore, the **Space Complexity is O(N²)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "I've refactored the function to eliminate the initial `if/elif` blocks and use a standard `for` loop, making it more concise. I will provide the updated Python file and the corrected intuition markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Your original code was perfectly functional and correct! The refactored version simply makes the initialization more generic, reducing the need for explicit edge case checks for `numRows=1` and `numRows=2`, and switches to a standard `for` loop structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also updated the complexity analysis in the `intuition_cell.md` to reflect the correct **O(N²)** space complexity, as the output requires storing all generated elements. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into alternative generation methods (like combinatorial formulas) or want to review code for a related problem!"
