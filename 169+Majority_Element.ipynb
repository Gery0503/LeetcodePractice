    "### üëã Opening Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. I'm confident in the correctness, efficiency, and simplicity of this solution. For this problem ‚Äî **finding the majority element** ‚Äî I opted for the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which offers both `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space complexity. It‚Äôs ideal for problems where a majority element is guaranteed to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Mindset and Step-by-Step Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are **guaranteed** that the majority element (appearing more than ‚åän/2‚åã times) exists.\n",
    "* We must return that element **efficiently** ‚Äî ideally in linear time and constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Why Boyer-Moore?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is specifically designed for such scenarios. It works in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Candidate Selection:** Cancel out each element that‚Äôs not the same as the current candidate. By the end of the loop, if there is a majority element, it must be the one left.\n",
    "* **Final Candidate:** Since we are guaranteed a majority, we can return the candidate directly without a second pass for verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Code Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `counter == 0`, reset `candidate` to current number.\n",
    "* Increment or decrement counter based on whether current number matches candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic ensures that the majority element is not ‚Äúcancelled out.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We loop through the array once, performing constant-time operations.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We use only two variables, `candidate` and `counter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåç Real-World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is highly relevant in distributed systems and real-time analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sensor fusion**: Detecting the dominant sensor reading in noisy data.\n",
    "* **Elections**: Streaming vote tallies to detect if a candidate is dominating.\n",
    "* **Error correction**: Finding the most frequent bit or signal among repeated, possibly corrupted transmissions.\n",
    "* **User behavior modeling**: Identifying the most common event/action in a real-time clickstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these situations, memory and latency are constraints, and this algorithm provides a perfect tradeoff.\n",

    "## üë®‚Äçüíº Interviewer Feedback (Switching Roles)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Excellent understanding** of problem constraints and leveraging the **guaranteed majority**.\n",
    "* Chose **the optimal algorithm** for time and space.\n",
    "* Code is clean, minimal, and expressive ‚Äî great for production-level clarity.\n",
    "* Recognized and explained real-world analogs, showing understanding beyond textbook knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Improvement Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "* You could mention that **if the guarantee of majority didn‚Äôt exist**, a second verification pass would be required.\n",
    "* Consider adding a brief docstring or comment to describe the algorithm at a high level ‚Äî improves maintainability for teammates unfamiliar with Boyer-Moore.\n",
    "* If this were part of a larger system, discuss testing strategies for edge cases like very large arrays, or integration with streaming data systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Final Verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong candidate. Demonstrates algorithmic maturity, optimal thinking, and clarity.** Would be comfortable trusting this candidate with production-critical, performance-sensitive data stream processing tasks.\n",
