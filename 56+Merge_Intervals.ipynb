    "\n",
    "Thank you for the opportunity. For this problem, I approached it using a classic greedy strategy after sorting the intervals. My mindset was to **first ensure order**, then **merge based on overlap conditions**.\n",

    "### üß† Step-by-Step Thought Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort by Start Time:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The first and most crucial step is to sort all intervals by their start times. This guarantees that when we iterate, we always compare each interval with the latest one in the result ‚Äî no backtracking needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate and Merge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I initialized the result list with the first interval.\n",
    "   * For each subsequent interval, we compare it with the last merged one:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Case 1 ‚Äì Overlap (partial extension):**\n",
    "       If the current start ‚â§ previous end < current end ‚Üí extend the interval.\n",
    "     * **Case 2 ‚Äì Full Overlap:**\n",
    "       If current end ‚â§ previous end ‚Üí skip (already covered).\n",
    "     * **Case 3 ‚Äì No Overlap:**\n",
    "       If current start > previous end ‚Üí new disjoint interval.\n",
