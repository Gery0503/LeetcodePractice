    "# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)` which returns:\n",
    "- `-1` : Your guess is higher than the number I picked.\n",
    "- `1` : Your guess is lower than the number I picked.\n",
    "- `0` : Your guess is equal to the number I picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number that I picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 10, pick = 6\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 1, pick = 1\n",

    "- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`\n",
    "- `1 <= pick <= n`\n"

    "# ✅ **Code Review for 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a detailed breakdown of what you did well, what can be improved, and optional enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **👍 Strengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Binary Search Implementation Is Correct**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You used the classic binary search pattern (`lower`, `upper`, `mid`) correctly.\n",
    "* Loop condition `while lower <= upper:` is appropriate.\n",
    "* Properly handles the three responses from `guess()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Time and Space Complexity Are Correct**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary search → `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "* Constant extra space → `O(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Code Readability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean and straightforward.\n",
    "* No unnecessary logic or premature optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🔍 Suggested Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mid-Point Overflow Guard (Minor)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ints don’t overflow, but the “mid formula” could be written in overflow-safe style for other languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mid = lower + (upper - lower) // 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Not necessary for Python, but worth learning as a habit for interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use `elif` Instead of Separate `if`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if guess_result == 0:\n",
    "    return mid\n",
    "if guess_result == -1:\n",
    "    upper = mid - 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    lower = mid + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `elif` improves clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if guess_result == 0:\n",
    "    return mid\n",
    "elif guess_result == -1:\n",
    "    upper = mid - 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    lower = mid + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes the branching logic more explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Add a Final Return (Optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically unreachable, but good practice for static analyzers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return -1  # Should never happen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Add Edge Case Notes in Your Intuition Section**\n",
    "\n",
    "You could note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No need to handle invalid input because constraints guarantee `1 ≤ pick ≤ n`.\n",
    "* The search range always shrinks and will terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps reinforce the reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **✨ Polished Version (Cleaned but Same Logic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def guessNumber(n):\n",
    "    lower, upper = 1, n\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while lower <= upper:\n",
    "        mid = lower + (upper - lower) // 2\n",
    "        result = guess(mid)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        if result == 0:\n",
    "            return mid\n",
    "        elif result == -1:\n",
    "            upper = mid - 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            lower = mid + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    return -1  # Safety fallback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🧠 Optional Additional Insight**\n",
    "\n",
    "You could mention in your intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This problem is essentially a “search space narrowing” type, identical to binary search.\n",
    "* `guess()` behaves like a comparator (`cmp(mid, target)`).\n",
    "* For LeetCode mock interviews, avoid recursion because recursion depth could exceed stack limits for large `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like, I can also help you rewrite your **Intuition** section into a polished version suitable for your notebook!\n"
