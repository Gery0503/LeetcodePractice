    "# 141. Linked List Cycle\n",

    "[Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)\n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Please access link to see the linked list image.)\n",
    "Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Please access link to see the linked list image.)\n",
    "Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Please access link to see the linked list image.)\n",
    "Input: head = [1], pos = -1\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.\n",
    "- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concept:** We use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `slow` moves one step at a time, while `fast` moves two steps. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually lap the `slow` pointer, and they will meet (`slow == fast`). If `fast` reaches the end of the list (`None`), there is no cycle.\n",
    "* **Key Refinements:**\n",
    "    * **Initialization:** Start both `slow` and `fast` at `head`.\n",
    "    * **Loop Condition:** Simplified to `while fast and fast.next:`. This uses Python's truthy evaluation to safely check for the end of the list and naturally handles the `head = None` edge case without needing an explicit `if not head:` check at the start.\n",
    "    * **Logic Order:** Placed the pointer updates (`slow = slow.next`, `fast = fast.next.next`) *before* the collision check (`if slow == fast:`) so they don't falsely return `True` on the very first iteration when both start at `head`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:**\n",
    "* **Time:** O(n). In the worst-case scenario, the fast pointer will catch the slow pointer in a number of steps proportional to the length of the list.\n",
    "* **Space:** O(1). We only allocate two pointers, requiring constant extra memory."
