    "You are playing the Nim Game with a friend:\n",
    "- There is initially a heap of `n` stones.\n",
    "- You always go first and players alternate turns.\n",
    "- On each turn, a player removes **1 to 3** stones.\n",
    "- The player who removes the **last stone wins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both players play optimally. Given `n`, return `True` if you can win the game, otherwise return `False`.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `n = 4`\n",
    "Output: `False`\n",
    "Explanation: No matter how many stones you remove (1â€“3), your friend can always force a win.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",

    "Hereâ€™s a structured **code review** of your Nim Game solution notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The mathematical insight is captured perfectly: losing positions are multiples of 4.\n",
    "   * The one-liner `return (n % 4) != 0` is both correct and optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The Markdown description is well-structured, includes examples, and links to the original problem.\n",
    "   * Readers can understand the problem setup without leaving the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A good set of assertions that verify correctness for both winning and losing cases.\n",
    "   * Covers small values systematically (1â€“9), showing the repeating pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Time complexity: **O(1)**\n",
    "   * Space complexity: **O(1)**\n",
    "   * Best possible solution for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code readability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The mathematical trick `(n % 4) != 0` is concise but might be cryptic to beginners.\n",
    "   * Suggest adding a short inline comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Winning positions are all n not divisible by 4\n",
    "     return n % 4 != 0\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing edge cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Current tests cover small numbers but not the constraint boundary.\n",
    "   * Add one test at the maximum input (`2**31 - 1`) to show the solution handles it efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     assert Solution().canWinNim(2**31 - 1) == True\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Docstring for clarity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Adding a function-level docstring would make the solution notebook even more self-contained:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Solution:\n",
    "         def canWinNim(self, n: int) -> bool:\n",
    "             \"\"\"\n",
    "             Determine if the first player can win Nim Game given n stones.\n",
    "             \n",
    "             A player loses only if n is a multiple of 4, since whatever they take,\n",
    "             the opponent can mirror to eventually leave another multiple of 4.\n",
    "             \"\"\"\n",
    "             return n % 4 != 0\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minor stylistic suggestion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In tests, you could loop instead of writing assertions individually:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     expected = [True, True, True, False, True, True, True, False, True]\n",
    "     for n, exp in enumerate(expected, start=1):\n",
    "         assert Solution().canWinNim(n) == exp\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸš€ Overall\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quality:** Excellent\n",
    "* **Clarity:** Very good, could benefit from a docstring/comment\n",
    "* **Tests:** Good coverage, but add a max-boundary case\n",
    "\n",
    "This is already a clean, optimal solution. The main improvements are documentation and showing robustness at constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to **refactor your test section** into a loop with both small and large edge cases so itâ€™s compact but thorough?\n"
