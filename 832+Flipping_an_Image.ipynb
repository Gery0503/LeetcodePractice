    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an $n \times n$ binary matrix `image`, flip the image **horizontally**, then invert it, and return the resulting image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed. For example, flipping `[1,1,0]` horizontally results in `[0,1,1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To invert an image means that each `0` is replaced by `1`, and each `1` is replaced by `0`. For example, inverting `[0,1,1]` results in `[1,0,0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]\n",
    "Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. Flip horizontally: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]\n",
    "2. Invert: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]\n",
    "```\n",

    "Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. Flip horizontally: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]]\n",
    "2. Invert: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]\n",

    "Hello\\! Based on your request and the instructions you've provided, I will first rewrite your prompt for clarity and effectiveness and then provide a thorough code review for the Python solution to the LeetCode problem \"Flipping an Image.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Clarity and Effectiveness Rewrite\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Goal:** Review the provided Python code for the LeetCode problem \"Flipping an Image\" (832).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rewritten Question:** \"Please perform a comprehensive code review on the provided Python solution for LeetCode problem 832, 'Flipping an Image'. The review should cover correctness, efficiency, code style, and potential areas for simplification, particularly focusing on combining the flip and invert operations into a single, optimized pass as hinted in the intuition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The rewrite clearly states the specific problem and requests a \"comprehensive code review\" covering key aspects like correctness, efficiency, and style, directly referencing the user's stated intuition about optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💻 Code Review: Flipping an Image\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided solution is **correct** and logically follows the problem description by separating the horizontal flip and the inversion into two distinct steps applied row by row. However, there is a significant opportunity to **optimize** the solution by combining these two steps into a single, more efficient pass, which aligns with your written intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Correctness and Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution correctly implements the two required operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Horizontal Flip (`flip` function):** Uses the two-pointer approach (`start` and `end`) to swap elements in place. This correctly reverses the row.\n",
    "2.  **Inversion (`invert` function):** Iterates through the array and uses the XOR operator (`^ 1`) to invert the binary values ($0 \\leftrightarrow 1$). This is a concise and standard way to perform the inversion on binary digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Efficiency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Current Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$\n",
    "      * The outer loop runs $N$ times (for $N$ rows).\n",
    "      * Inside the loop, `flip` takes $O(N)$ time, and `invert` takes $O(N)$ time.\n",
    "      * Total time complexity is $N \\times (O(N) + O(N)) = O(N^2)$.\n",
    "      * *(Note: This is the optimal time complexity since every element in the $N \\times N$ matrix must be processed.)*\n",
    "  * **Current Space Complexity:** $O(1)$ (excluding the input/output matrix).\n",
    "      * The operations are performed in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Optimization and Simplification (Single Pass)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your intuition correctly noted that the operations can be combined. The key is to recognize that when swapping two elements $A$ and $B$ (the flip), you can also invert them at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a row `[..., A, ..., B, ...]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Flip:** Swap $A$ and $B$. Row becomes `[..., B, ..., A, ...]`.\n",
    "2.  **Invert:** Invert the new $B$ and $A$. Row becomes `[..., !B, ..., !A, ...]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can achieve the combined operation by swapping $A$ and $B$, **then inverting both of them in the same step.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Instead of `arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]`, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Swap the inverted values\n",
    "    arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end] ^ 1, arr[start] ^ 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wait\\! This is incorrect because you need to use the *original* values of `arr[start]` and `arr[end]` to compute their inverted swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The correct way to perform the **flip and invert in one combined step** is to first swap the elements, and then immediately invert the element at the `start` position (which now holds the *flipped* value) and the element at the `end` position (which now holds the *flipped* value).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since the logic is $\\text{flip} \\rightarrow \\text{invert}$, we can combine it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{Flipped Value} = \\text{Original Value}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{Final Value} = \\text{Invert}(\\text{Flipped Value}) = \\text{Original Value} \\oplus 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider a pair of elements, $A$ at `start` and $B$ at `end`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Combined Operation for $A$ (now at `end`'s position):** $A \\rightarrow \\text{Invert}(A) = A \\oplus 1$\n",
    "    2.  **Combined Operation for $B$ (now at `start`'s position):** $B \\rightarrow \\text{Invert}(B) = B \\oplus 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "    The key is to swap the positions and then invert the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Store original values\n",
    "    temp_start = arr[start]\n",
    "    temp_end = arr[end]\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Place the inverted, swapped values\n",
    "    arr[start] = temp_end ^ 1 # Place inverted 'B' at 'start'\n",
    "    arr[end] = temp_start ^ 1 # Place inverted 'A' at 'end'\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can do this with a cleaner simultaneous assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Combined flip and invert: new_start = !old_end; new_end = !old_start\n",
    "    arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end] ^ 1, arr[start] ^ 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This single line replaces the entire `flip` function and the subsequent `invert` call for the element pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Handling the middle element (odd length rows):**\n",
    "    If the row has an odd length, the middle element will be reached when $start = end$. In this case, it just needs to be inverted. The loop condition `while start < end:` only handles pairs.\n",
    "    If we change the loop to `while start <= end:` and use the combined swap, the middle element (`start == end`) will be assigned:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # When start == end:\n",
    "    arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end] ^ 1, arr[start] ^ 1 \n",
    "    # This simplifies to: arr[start] = arr[start] ^ 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This correctly handles the single middle element\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✍️ Refactored and Optimized Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire logic can be condensed into one cleaner, single-pass function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def flipAndInvertImage_optimized(image: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n",
    "    for row in image:\n",
    "        n = len(row)\n",
    "        start, end = 0, n - 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Iterate until the pointers cross, ensuring the middle element is included\n",
    "        while start <= end:\n",
    "            # Combined flip and invert:\n",
    "            # The new element at 'start' is the inverted old element from 'end'.\n",
    "            # The new element at 'end' is the inverted old element from 'start'.\n",
    "            # This works even when start == end (the middle element).\n",
    "            row[start], row[end] = row[end] ^ 1, row[start] ^ 1\n",
    "            \n",
    "            start += 1\n",
    "            end -= 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is how the two operations are represented mathematically, and why the full process is categorized as an **affine transformation**, not a purely linear one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Horizontal Flip (Linear Transformation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipping a row vector $\\mathbf{r}$ horizontally is a **linear transformation** called a **permutation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Row Vector ($\\mathbf{r}$):** A single row of the image is an $n$-dimensional vector:\n",
    "    $$\\mathbf{r} = [r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Permutation Matrix ($P$):** We can define a square $n \\times n$ matrix $P$ that acts as a reversal operator. This matrix is the anti-diagonal identity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For $n=4$:\n",
    "    $$P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transformation:** The flipped vector $\\mathbf{r}'$ is found by matrix multiplication:\n",
    "    $$\\mathbf{r}' = \\mathbf{r} P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    *For example, if $\\mathbf{r} = [1, 1, 0, 0]$, then $\\mathbf{r}' = [1, 1, 0, 0] \\cdot P = [0, 0, 1, 1]$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Inversion ($0 \\leftrightarrow 1$) (Affine Transformation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inversion operation is **not a linear transformation** because it involves adding a constant offset. It is an **affine transformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inversion Operator:** Inversion is mathematically equivalent to subtracting the vector from a vector of all ones, $\\mathbf{1}$:\n",
    "    $$\\mathbf{r}'' = \\mathbf{1} - \\mathbf{r}'$$\n",
    "    where $\\mathbf{1} = [1, 1, \\ldots, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *This transformation is affine because $T(\\mathbf{x}) = A\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is the identity matrix multiplied by $-1$, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the constant vector $\\mathbf{1}$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Combined Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete process is the composition of the two transformations:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{r}'' = \\mathbf{1} - (\\mathbf{r} P)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Array Approach is Better\n",
    "\n",
    "While the linear algebra model is mathematically rigorous, it is not used for implementation in this context for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Efficiency:** For a simple permutation and bitwise subtraction, iterating through the elements ($O(N)$ for a row) is significantly faster than calculating and performing a matrix multiplication ($O(N^2)$ for a row) just to achieve the same result.\n",
    "2.  **Affinity:** The inversion operation means you cannot represent the entire process as a single, simple multiplication $M \\mathbf{r}$, which is the core benefit of linear algebra.\n",
    "3.  **Simplicity:** The array-based solution is simpler to read and implement: swap elements and invert them simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
