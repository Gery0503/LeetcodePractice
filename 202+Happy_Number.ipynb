    "### Description\n",
    "A **happy number** is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the **sum of the squares of its digits**. Repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay) or loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Return `true` if it becomes 1; otherwise, return `false`.\n",

    "1. **Correctness**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The use of a `history` set ensures loop detection, preventing infinite cycles.\n",
    "   * The digit-sum-square transformation is correctly implemented with `% 10` and `// 10`.\n",
    "   * Test assertions cover both happy and unhappy cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The function is short, and the logic is easy to follow.\n",
    "   * Comments inside the loop clarify what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Handles `n = 1` directly, since it will eventually return `True`.\n",
    "   * Large values are safe because each step reduces the number to at most `9¬≤ * digits` (bounded to ‚â§ 243 for any input).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues & Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loop Condition & Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Current loop is `while True` + `break`, which makes flow less clean.\n",
    "   * More readable: `while n != 1 and n not in history:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while n != 1 and n not in history:\n",
    "       history.add(n)\n",
    "       n = sum((int(d)**2 for d in str(n)))\n",
    "   return n == 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This way, you avoid `break` and the final `if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Digit Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Current method uses manual `%` and `//` in a nested loop. It works but is verbose.\n",
    "   * Cleaner alternative: convert to string and use generator expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   n = sum(int(d)**2 for d in str(n))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This improves readability without impacting performance significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency (Optional Optimization)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead of a `set` for loop detection, one could use **Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare)**.\n",
    "   * This avoids `O(k)` space and uses `O(1)` space.\n",
    "   * Tradeoff: a bit less intuitive, but better asymptotics.\n"
