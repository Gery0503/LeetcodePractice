    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letters are case sensitive, so `\"a\"` is considered a different type of stone from `\"A\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jewels = \"aA\", stones = \"aAAbbbb\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: jewels = \"z\", stones = \"ZZ\"\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`\n",
    "- `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.\n",
    "- All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**."

    "### Code Review: Jewels and Stones (LeetCode 771)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a clean and effective solution for an \"Easy\" level problem. You correctly identified that optimization relies on how quickly you can look up current stones in the `jewels` collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of your approach and a crucial optimization for your Python one-liner.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Main Solution (`numJewelsInStones`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Set Conversion:** `jewels = set(jewels)` is the most important line. It converts the lookup time from **Linear** () to **Constant** ().\n",
    "* **Readability:** The variable names are clear, and the logic flows naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minor Refinement:**\n",
    "While valid, reusing the variable name `jewels` to store the `set` (when it was originally a `string`) can sometimes confuse type-checkers or readers in larger functions. A distinct name like `jewel_set` is often preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The One-Liner Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Your one-liner is Pythonic, but it contains a hidden performance cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return sum(s in jewels for s in stones)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version, `jewels` is still a **string**. Therefore, for *every* stone, Python performs a linear scan through the `jewels` string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized:**\n",
    "You can force the set conversion inside the function or use the set explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def numJewelsInStones_oneliners(jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:\n",
    "    jewel_set = set(jewels) # Create set once\n",
    "    return sum(s in jewel_set for s in stones) # O(1) lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Complexity | Explanation |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Time** |  | We iterate through `jewels` once to create the set () and `stones` once to count (). |\n",
    "| **Space** |  | We store a set containing unique characters from `jewels`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In your notebook, you mentioned \n",
    "\n",
    " time, which simplifies to linear time relative to input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Refined Code Snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the polished version combining your logic with the type hint clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def numJewelsInStones(jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:\n",
    "    # Space: O(J) - Create a hash set for O(1) lookups\n",
    "    jewel_set = set(jewels)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Time: O(S) - Iterate through stones once\n",
    "    # Boolean True is treated as 1, False as 0\n",
    "    return sum(s in jewel_set for s in stones)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Step:** Would you like to try a slightly harder variation, like **\"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\"**, which uses a similar \"Set/Window\" concept?"
