    "\n",
    "The problem asks us to identify the one integer in the array that **does not have a duplicate**, while all other integers appear **exactly twice**. We're constrained to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **O(n) time complexity**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Thought Process & Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "My immediate thought was to use the **bitwise XOR operation** based on a few key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `a ^ a = 0`: XOR-ing a number with itself cancels it out.\n",
    "2. `a ^ 0 = a`: XOR-ing with 0 returns the original number.\n",
    "3. XOR is **commutative** and **associative**, so the order of operations doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given those properties, if we XOR all numbers together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every number that appears twice will cancel itself out.\n",
    "* The only number left will be the one that appears once.\n",

    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Packet Transmission Integrity**: XOR checksums help detect single-bit corruption.\n",
    "* **Hardware Fault Detection**: XOR gates in digital circuits are used in parity checkers.\n",
    "* **Embedded systems** where memory is limited and constant space is critical.\n",
    "* **Data synchronization**: Identifying mismatched IDs when merging logs or events from distributed systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Excellent choice** of algorithm ‚Äî using XOR is a classic, efficient trick.\n",
    "* Clear understanding of **bitwise properties** and how they apply to the problem.\n",
    "* Code is minimal, **clean**, and **scalable** for up to 10‚Å¥ elements.\n",
    "* You demonstrated awareness of **low-level operations** and their practical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "* Though you identified XOR instantly, in a real-world engineering context, make sure to **briefly explain alternatives** (e.g., HashSet with O(n) space) and why they are inferior under these constraints.\n",
    "* It‚Äôs a good idea to **mention edge cases**, such as empty input, even if constraints say it won‚Äôt happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° What I Would Do\n",
    "\n",
    "* I would use the XOR method, just like you.\n",
    "* I would consider wrapping this logic in a reusable utility function (e.g., for future unit testing or fault-checking systems).\n",
    "* For a follow-up, I might ask how you‚Äôd extend this solution if numbers appear *three times* except one (hint: bitmasking / finite-state machines).\n",

    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Verdict**: Excellent solution with strong grasp of both theory and application. I would confidently recommend you for further rounds.\n",
