    "Thank you for the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "I approached this problem using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with a recursive top-down strategy and also implemented an **iterative version** using an explicit stack. The key observation is that a **valid BST requires every node** to follow a global constraint: all left subtree nodes must be strictly less than the current node, and all right subtree nodes must be strictly greater.\n",

    "#### ✔️ Recursive (Top-Down DFS)\n",

    "* ⚠️ The recursive solution is elegant but could fail for deep trees (e.g., 10^4 nodes) in Python without tail call optimization. It’s worth noting mitigation (e.g., system recursion limit or iterative fallback).\n",
    "* 💡 Could also mention the in-order traversal property of BSTs (sorted order) as an alternate solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I'd Do:**\n",

    "* I’d consider implementing an **in-order traversal solution**, which checks if the tree produces a strictly increasing sequence of values. This is also O(n) and has the benefit of relying only on local node comparison.\n",

    "### 🔍 1. **Recursive DFS (Top-down with bounds)**\n",

    "\n",
    "* Elegant, expressive logic using bounds to verify BST rules.\n",
    "* Short-circuits early if a violation is found (minimal traversal).\n",

    "#### ❌ Cons:\n",

    "#### 🧠 Performance Notes:\n",
