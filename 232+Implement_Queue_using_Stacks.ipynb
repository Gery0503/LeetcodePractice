    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `MyQueue` class:\n",
    "- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.\n",
    "- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n",
    "- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "- `boolean empty()` Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- You must use **only** standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.\n",
    "- Depending on your language, your stack implementation may not be limited to using only a stack. You may use a list or deque if it is used as a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();\n",
    "myQueue.push(1);\n",
    "myQueue.push(2);\n",
    "myQueue.peek(); // return 1\n",
    "myQueue.pop();  // return 1\n",
    "myQueue.empty(); // return false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- `1 <= x <= 9`\n",
    "- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.\n",
    "- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is **amortized O(1)** time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer."

    "\n",
    "* In your first version, immediately highlight that it's **correct but not optimal**, then pivot quickly.\n",
    "* It‚Äôs helpful to abstract `shift()` to improve code readability and prevent duplication in `pop()` and `peek()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° What I‚Äôd Do\n",
    "\n",
    "I would directly implement the **amortized two-stack model** with delayed transfer and discuss edge case testing. Optionally, I‚Äôd add a `size()` function or a `reset()` method for production readiness.\n",
