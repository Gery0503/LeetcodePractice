    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧐 Code Review: Pascal's Triangle II\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Overall Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is **correct** and handles the base case (`rowIndex = 0`) properly. The recursive structure is clean and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Performance & Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The main area for improvement is addressing the **Space Complexity** challenge mentioned in the problem's follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1\\. Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Current Time Complexity:** $O(\\text{rowIndex}^2)$ or $O(k^2)$, where $k$ is $rowIndex$.\n",
    "  * **Analysis:** Each recursive call for `getRow(r)` iterates $r$ times. The total number of additions is $1 + 2 + \\dots + \\text{rowIndex}$, which is $O(\\text{rowIndex}^2)$. This is optimal for calculating all elements up to this row.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\\. Space Complexity (The Issue)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Current Space Complexity:** $O(\\text{rowIndex}^2)$ or $O(k^2)$ (due to recursion stack).\n",
    "  * **Analysis:**\n",
    "      * **Auxiliary Space (excluding recursion):** $O(\\text{rowIndex})$ for storing `current_row` and `previous_row` at each level.\n",
    "      * **Recursion Stack Space:** $O(\\text{rowIndex})$ depth, where each call stores its local variables (`previous_row`, `current_row`).\n",
    "      * **Total Space:** The `previous_row` list returned by each sub-call is kept in memory by the caller. Since the lengths are $1, 2, \\dots, \\text{rowIndex}+1$, the total space used is $O(\\text{rowIndex}^2)$. This **does not meet the $O(k)$ extra space constraint.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Suggested Improvement: Iterative $O(k)$ Space Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet the $O(k)$ space constraint, we need an **iterative** approach that reuses a single list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to calculate the row *in-place* starting from the second element from the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a row $R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * $R[i] = R_{\\text{previous}}[i-1] + R_{\\text{previous}}[i]$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only use one list, say `current_row`, and update it from left to right, when we calculate $current\\_row[i]$, we will overwrite $current\\_row[i-1]$ *before* we need its original value for the next calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Iterate from **right to left** (from $i$ up to 1). When calculating the new value for $R[i]$, both $R[i-1]$ and $R[i]$ still hold the correct values from the previous row calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Revised Iterative Code (Meeting $O(k)$ Space):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def getRow_optimized(rowIndex: int) -> List[int]:\n",
    "    # Initialize the row with all 1s (Row 0 is [1], Row 1 is [1, 1], etc.)\n",
    "    # The length of the rowIndex-th row is rowIndex + 1.\n",
    "    result = [1] * (rowIndex + 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Start loop from row 2 (r=2) up to the target rowIndex (r=rowIndex)\n",
    "    # Row 0 and Row 1 are base cases handled by the initialization of result.\n",
    "    for r in range(2, rowIndex + 1):\n",
    "        # Calculate elements for row 'r' using the current 'result' list\n",
    "        # which represents the previous row (r-1).\n",
    "        # We must iterate from right to left (i from r-1 down to 1) \n",
    "        # to use the previous row's values before they are overwritten.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # r is the length of the current row minus 1 (index of the last element, which is 1)\n",
    "        # We stop at index 1 because result[0] is always 1.\n",
    "        for i in range(r - 1, 0, -1):\n",
    "            # Pascal's rule: element = previous[i-1] + previous[i]\n",
    "            # Since we iterate right-to-left:\n",
    "            # result[i-1] holds previous[i-1]\n",
    "            # result[i] holds previous[i]\n",
    "            result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i]\n",
