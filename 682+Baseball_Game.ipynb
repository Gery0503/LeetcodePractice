    "You are keeping the score for a baseball game with special rules. You start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings `operations`, where each operation is one of the following:\n",
    "- An integer `x`: record this number of points.\n",
    "- `\"+\"`: record points equal to the sum of the previous two valid scores.\n",
    "- `\"D\"`: record points equal to double the previous valid score.\n",
    "- `\"C\"`: invalidate and remove the previous valid score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sum of all valid points after processing all operations.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `operations = [\"5\",\"2\",\"C\",\"D\",\"+\"]`\n",
