    "[Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "There is a robot starting at position `(0, 0)`, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at `(0, 0)` after it completes all of its moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `moves` that represents the move sequence of the robot where `moves[i]` represents its *i-th* move. Valid moves are **'R'** (right), **'L'** (left), **'U'** (up), and **'D'** (down). Return `true` if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The way the robot is ‚Äúfacing‚Äù is irrelevant. 'R' will always make the robot move to the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc. Assume each move has the same magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `moves = \"UD\"`\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",

    "- `1 <= moves.length <= 2 * 10^4`\n",
    "- `moves` only contains the characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`"

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correctness**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Your implementation is correct and passes the provided test cases.\n",
    "   * Both vertical (`U/D`) and horizontal (`L/R`) movements are handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Variable names (`count_UD`, `count_LR`) are descriptive and intuitive.\n",
    "   * The loop structure is easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Time complexity:** O(n), iterating once through the moves string.\n",
    "   * **Space complexity:** O(1), only two counters are used.\n",
    "   * This is optimal for the problem constraints (`n ‚â§ 20,000`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You included diverse test cases, including balanced moves, imbalance, and different sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Suggested Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplify counters**\n",
    "   Instead of manually managing `count_UD` and `count_LR`, you can use Python‚Äôs `str.count()` to directly compare counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Solution:\n",
    "       def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:\n",
    "           return moves.count('U') == moves.count('D') and moves.count('L') == moves.count('R')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Pros:** Shorter and very readable.\n",
    "   * **Cons:** Slightly less efficient (`O(n)` for each count, so \\~`O(4n)` overall). Still fine for constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative with dictionary mapping**\n",
    "   To make it more extensible (if new moves were added in a variant problem):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Solution:\n",
    "       def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:\n",
    "           x, y = 0, 0\n",
    "           directions = {'U': (0, 1), 'D': (0, -1), 'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0)}\n",
    "           for m in moves:\n",
    "               dx, dy = directions[m]\n",
    "               x, y = x + dx, y + dy\n",
    "           return x == 0 and y == 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * More general, but slightly more verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing edge cases**\n",
    "   Add additional edge cases to ensure robustness:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   assert Solution().judgeCircle(\"\") == True   # empty string, still at origin\n",
    "   assert Solution().judgeCircle(\"UUDD\") == True  # multiple canceling moves\n",
    "   assert Solution().judgeCircle(\"UUU\") == False  # only up moves\n",
    "   assert Solution().judgeCircle(\"LRLRLRLR\") == True  # alternating moves\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**\n",
    "   Adding a short docstring improves readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Solution:\n",
    "       def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           Return True if the robot returns to the origin after performing moves.\n",
    "           'U' = up, 'D' = down, 'L' = left, 'R' = right.\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ Overall\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correct, efficient, and clean.**\n",
    "* Can be simplified further with Python built-ins (`count`) or made more extensible with a dictionary-based approach.\n",
    "* Good test coverage, just add edge cases for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
