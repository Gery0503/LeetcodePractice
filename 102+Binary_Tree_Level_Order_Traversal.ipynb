    "### ‚úÖ **Candidate (Senior Algorithms Engineer) Perspective**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üí¨ Implementation Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for this problem because it naturally aligns with the requirement: \"return level order traversal.\" BFS visits nodes level by level, making it a clean and intuitive fit for grouping values at each depth into sublists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I initialized a queue using `collections.deque`, which gives O(1) pops from the front.\n",
    "* I iteratively processed nodes level by level, using a `for` loop to extract exactly the number of nodes at the current level.\n",
    "* For each node, I stored its value and pushed its children into the queue for the next round.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method avoids recursion (which could hit stack depth limits on large trees) and maintains a clear separation of levels, which matches the output requirements precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßÆ Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity: O(n)**\n",
    "  Every node is visited exactly once. We spend constant time per node to process it and push children.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Space Complexity: O(w)**\n",
    "  The queue holds at most `w` nodes at a time, where `w` is the maximum width of the tree ‚Äî the number of nodes at the widest level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üåê Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of level-order traversal is widely applicable in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organizational charts or hierarchies:** To extract or display employees/managers level by level.\n",
    "2. **AI pathfinding algorithms:** BFS is used in shortest-path calculations (e.g., in grid-based games or routing).\n",
    "3. **Network analysis:** Propagation simulation (e.g., virus spread, BFS to find shortest connection).\n",
    "4. **Serialization of Trees:** Useful in converting data structures to/from storage or transmission formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Level-order traversal offers predictable and structured tree processing, which is important in many system designs that involve hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üë®‚Äçüíº **Interviewer Mode: Technical Feedback**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Candidate Strengths:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You identified BFS as the optimal strategy for level-order traversal ‚Äî which shows strong algorithmic alignment with the problem.\n",
    "* Your use of `deque` demonstrates attention to time efficiency.\n",
    "* Clean loop structure and level separation logic make the code easy to read and modify.\n",
    "* Good practice with defensive programming (`if not root` case).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Opportunities for Improvement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You could add inline comments to explain each major step ‚Äî especially for interview or team-sharing scenarios.\n",
    "* Consider edge cases: very deep or very wide trees. Could you protect against memory pressure or optimize further using a generator or streaming interface?\n",
    "* For very large trees, briefly mentioning alternative traversal mechanisms (e.g., iterative DFS with depth tracking) can show depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I‚Äôd Do As Well:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* I'd implement unit tests with large trees (e.g., 1000+ nodes) to validate scalability.\n",
    "* I might wrap the solution into a class interface or expose hooks for depth filtering, which could make it reusable in an API or system backend.\n",
    "* If used in production (say, in org-visualization), I would cache frequent subtrees or leverage pagination techniques at each depth level."
